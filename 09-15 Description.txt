I have included 2 files I have recorded myself in the Pittsburgh area. The first one is of me waiting outside the bus station of the nearby Giant Eagle. The second recording is of me 

I have also downloaded some sounds which I have included in my soundscape. Theses are mainly video game like sounds which are intended to enhance the feel of the story-world I want to create, which is a video game infused with the sounds of real life.
